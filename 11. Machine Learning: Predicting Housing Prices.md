   - Identifying key features affecting housing prices.
   - Using statistical methods to select the most relevant features.

3. **Model Development**
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting.
   - Training and validating the models on the collected dataset.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating the models using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
   - Comparing the performance of different models.

## Expected Results
- Accurate prediction of housing prices.
- Insights into the factors influencing housing prices.
- Recommendations for selecting the best machine learning model for housing price prediction.

## Conclusion
Machine learning models can effectively predict housing prices and provide valuable insights into the factors affecting them. This thesis aims to develop accurate models and evaluate their performance in predicting housing prices.
