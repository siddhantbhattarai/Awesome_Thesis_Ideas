# Automated Code Review System

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an automated code review system using machine learning techniques. The system will analyze code submissions and provide feedback on code quality, style, and potential bugs, reducing the manual effort required for code review.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Collecting a dataset of code submissions and corresponding code review comments.
   - Preprocessing the code submissions to extract features such as syntax, structure, and complexity.

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms for code review, such as classification and regression models.
   - Training the model on the collected dataset to learn patterns in code quality and style.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Testing the model on a separate validation dataset to assess its performance.
   - Evaluating the effectiveness of the automated code review system in comparison to manual code review.

## Expected Results
- Reduction in the time and effort required for code review.
- Consistent and objective feedback on code quality and style.
- Improvement in code maintainability and reliability.
