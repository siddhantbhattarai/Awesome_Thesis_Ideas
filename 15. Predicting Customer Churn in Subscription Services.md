# Predicting Customer Churn in Subscription Services

## Introduction
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in subscription-based services using predictive modeling techniques. By identifying customers at risk of churning, businesses can proactively implement retention strategies to reduce churn rates and increase customer lifetime value.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathering historical customer data including demographics, usage patterns, and subscription details.
   - Preprocessing the data to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering.

2. **Model Development**
   - Implementing machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests for churn prediction.
   - Training the model on labeled data to learn patterns indicative of churn behavior.

3. **Evaluation**
   - Assessing the performance of the churn prediction model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Analyzing the factors contributing to customer churn and deriving actionable insights for retention strategies.

## Expected Results
- Early identification of customers likely to churn, enabling proactive intervention and targeted retention efforts.
- Reduction in customer churn rates and associated revenue losses.
- Optimization of marketing and customer acquisition strategies based on insights gained from churn analysis.
