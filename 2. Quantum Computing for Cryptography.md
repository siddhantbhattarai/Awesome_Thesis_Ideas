# Quantum Computing for Cryptography

## Introduction
Quantum computing is poised to revolutionize many fields, including cryptography. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, such as RSA and ECC, are based on mathematical problems that are difficult for classical computers to solve. However, quantum computers have the potential to solve these problems exponentially faster, posing both risks and opportunities. This thesis explores the impact of quantum computing on cryptography, focusing on quantum-resistant algorithms and the future of secure communication.
