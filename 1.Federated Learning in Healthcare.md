# Federated Learning in Healthcare

## Introduction
Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging approach in the field of machine learning that enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train a model while keeping their data decentralized and secure. This paradigm is particularly advantageous in healthcare, where data privacy and security are paramount. This thesis aims to explore the applications, benefits, and challenges of Federated Learning in the healthcare sector.

## Abstract
Federated Learning offers a promising solution to leverage the vast amounts of data generated in healthcare while maintaining data privacy and security. This thesis explores the potential of Federated Learning in improving healthcare outcomes, analyzing its advantages, challenges, and future prospects.

## Introduction
The healthcare industry generates a significant amount of data that can be utilized to improve patient outcomes, enhance diagnostics, and advance medical research. However, data privacy concerns and regulatory requirements often hinder the sharing and utilization of this data. Federated Learning (FL) provides a solution by enabling the collaborative training of machine learning models without the need to centralize patient data. This thesis investigates the implementation of FL in healthcare, its potential benefits, and the challenges it poses.
