# Edge Computing for IoT Applications

## Introduction
Edge computing is a paradigm that brings computation and data storage closer to the location where it is needed, improving response times and saving bandwidth. This approach is particularly valuable for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where real-time processing and low latency are crucial. This thesis explores the implementation of edge computing in IoT environments, its benefits, and the challenges involved.
