2. **Multi-hop Routing Protocols**
   - Designing multi-hop routing protocols that optimize packet forwarding paths, minimize end-to-end delay, and conserve energy.
   - Incorporating intelligent routing metrics such as node centrality, residual energy, and link stability into routing decision processes.

3. **Machine Learning-based Routing**
   - Exploring machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, neural networks, and decision trees for adaptive routing in MANETs.
   - Training routing models using historical network data and reinforcement learning algorithms to learn optimal routing policies.

4. **Simulation and Performance Evaluation**
   - Simulating routing protocols and algorithms using network simulation tools like ns-3 or OMNeT++.
   - Evaluating the performance of intelligent routing protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, network throughput, and energy efficiency.

## Expected Results
